# Python-API-Challenge


This assignment uses **Python Requests**, **APIs**, and **JSON traversal** to the question: **"What's the weather as we approach the equator?"**


APIs used: OpenWeatherMapAPI and Geoapify



**OpenWeatherMapAPI** was used to create plots comparing (using coordinates from many cities): 

-Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

-Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

-Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

-Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

-Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

-Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

-Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

-Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude



**Geoapify** was used to create a map that displayed the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of a city's coordinates, provided it had ideal weather (specified parameters set in script)
